Jeopardy project

This project is a game that facilitates the use of socket connections server/client connections.
The entirety of this game is to create a simple interface that allows users to communicate with a server that allows
extraction of data(Jeopardy Q&A) via JSon parser from an online website.

Each question is simply modelled as a "daily double"

Run the program via the main() function in the server class and follow the prompt on the console

For easy use I have allowed the answers to be displayed on the console screen for test of functionality
